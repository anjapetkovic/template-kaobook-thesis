The study of meta-theory of type theory is certainly an important step towards making type theories, and the proof assistants they enable, more compatible. With the fast development of computer science and software tools, it is imperative that the proofs stay on solid grounds, which we can achieve by a deep understanding of the mathematical content beneath. While in this thesis we took steps in the directions of transformations and equality checking for type theories, there are certainly many more areas to investigate and improve on. We are looking forward to reading the possible next chapters on the meta-analysis of type theories and other formal systems. Hopefully the story of Carla will inspire new young (and old) minds to join the effort.
